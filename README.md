Disclaimer: I'm not sure if people are still playing this or not, or if anyone will even read this, but this project has been abandoned for a long time due to real life circumstances. However, if there's interest enough, I could pick it back up and give it some polish before improving with new stuff, or I could do a totally different game.

Current version: alpha v0.9.1

This was an idea that was on my head for a few days now. I've finally had the patience to sit down and actually code.
It is currently in a very early stage, but it's playable enough for me to be satisfied with posting it here.

I'm currently looking for ideas for spells and upgrades. You can open an issue for that. If possible, tell me how far you have progressed into the tower.
